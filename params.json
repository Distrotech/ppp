{"name":"Ppp","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.ozlabs.org/~paulus/ppp.git","body":"This is the README file for ppp-2.4, a package which implements the\r\nPoint-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to provide Internet connections over\r\nserial lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction.\r\n*************\r\n\r\nThe Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a standard way to establish\r\na network connection over a serial link.  At present, this package\r\nsupports IP and IPV6 and the protocols layered above them, such as TCP\r\nand UDP.  The Linux port of this package also has support for IPX.\r\n\r\nThis PPP implementation consists of two parts:\r\n\r\n- Kernel code, which establishes a network interface and passes\r\npackets between the serial port, the kernel networking code and the\r\nPPP daemon (pppd).  This code is implemented using STREAMS modules on\r\nSolaris, and as a line discipline under Linux.\r\n\r\n- The PPP daemon (pppd), which negotiates with the peer to establish\r\nthe link and sets up the ppp network interface.  Pppd includes support\r\nfor authentication, so you can control which other systems may make a\r\nPPP connection and what IP addresses they may use.\r\n\r\nThe platforms supported by this package are Linux and Solaris.  I have\r\ncode for NeXTStep, FreeBSD, SunOS 4.x, SVR4, Tru64 (Digital Unix), AIX\r\nand Ultrix but no active maintainers for these platforms.  Code for\r\nall of these except AIX is included in the ppp-2.3.11 release.\r\n\r\nThe kernel code for Linux is no longer distributed with this package,\r\nsince the relevant kernel code is in the official Linux kernel source\r\n(and has been for many years) and is included in all reasonably modern\r\nLinux distributions.  The Linux kernel code supports using PPP over\r\nthings other than serial ports, such as PPP over Ethernet and PPP over\r\nATM.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation.\r\n*************\r\n\r\nThe file SETUP contains general information about setting up your\r\nsystem for using PPP.  There is also a README file for each supported\r\nsystem, which contains more specific details for installing PPP on\r\nthat system.  The supported systems, and the corresponding README\r\nfiles, are:\r\n\r\n\tLinux\t\t\t\tREADME.linux\r\n\tSolaris\t\t\t\tREADME.sol2\r\n\r\nIn each case you start by running the ./configure script.  This works\r\nout which operating system you are using and creates the appropriate\r\nmakefiles.  You then run `make' to compile the user-level code, and\r\n(as root) `make install' to install the user-level programs pppd, chat\r\nand pppstats.\r\n\r\nN.B. Since 2.3.0, leaving the permitted IP addresses column of the\r\npap-secrets or chap-secrets file empty means that no addresses are\r\npermitted.  You need to put a \"*\" in that column to allow the peer to\r\nuse any IP address.  (This only applies where the peer is\r\nauthenticating itself to you, of course.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's new in ppp-2.4.5.\r\n************************\r\n\r\n* Under Linux, pppd can now operate in a mode where it doesn't request\r\n  the peer's IP address, as some peers refuse to supply an IP address.\r\n  Since Linux supports device routes as well as gateway routes, it's\r\n  possible to have no remote IP address assigned to the ppp interface\r\n  and still route traffic over it.\r\n\r\n* Pppd now works better with 3G modems that do strange things such as\r\n  sending IPCP Configure-Naks with the same values over and over again.\r\n\r\n* The PPP over L2TP plugin is included, which works with the pppol2tp\r\n  PPP channel code in the Linux kernel.  This allows pppd to be used\r\n  to set up tunnels using the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol.\r\n\r\n* A new 'enable-session' option has been added, which enables session\r\n  accounting via PAM or wtwp/wtmpx, as appropriate.  See the pppd man\r\n  page for details.\r\n\r\n* Several bugs have been fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was new in ppp-2.4.4.\r\n**************************\r\n\r\n* Pppd will now run /etc/ppp/ip-pre-up, if it exists, after creating\r\n  the ppp interface and configuring its IP addresses but before\r\n  bringing it up.  This can be used, for example, for adding firewall\r\n  rules for the interface.\r\n\r\n* Lots of bugs fixed, particularly in the area of demand-dialled and\r\n  persistent connections.\r\n\r\n* The rp-pppoe plugin now accepts any interface name (that isn't an\r\n  existing pppd option name) without putting \"nic-\" on the front of\r\n  it, not just eth*, nas*, tap* and br*.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was new in ppp-2.4.3.\r\n**************************\r\n\r\n* The configure script now accepts --prefix and --sysconfdir options.\r\n  These default to /usr/local and /etc.  If you want pppd put in\r\n  /usr/sbin as before, use ./configure --prefix=/usr.\r\n\r\n* Doing `make install' no longer puts example configuration files in\r\n  /etc/ppp.  Use `make install-etcppp' if you want that.\r\n\r\n* The code has been updated to work with version 0.8.3 of libpcap.\r\n  Unfortunately the libpcap maintainers removed support for the\r\n  \"inbound\" and \"outbound\" keywords on PPP links, meaning that if you\r\n  link pppd with libpcap-0.8.3, you can't use those keywords in the\r\n  active-filter and pass-filter expressions.  The support has been\r\n  reinstated in the CVS version and should be in future libpcap\r\n  releases.  If you need the in/outbound keywords, use a later release\r\n  than 0.8.3, or get the CVS version from http://www.tcpdump.org.\r\n\r\n* There is a new option, child-timeout, which sets the length of time\r\n  that pppd will wait for child processes (such as the command\r\n  specified with the pty option) to exit before exiting itself.  It\r\n  defaults to 5 seconds.  After the timeout, pppd will send a SIGTERM\r\n  to any remaining child processes and exit.  A value of 0 means no\r\n  timeout.\r\n\r\n* Various bugs have been fixed, including some CBCP packet parsing\r\n  bugs that could lead to the peer being able to crash pppd if CBCP\r\n  support is enabled.\r\n\r\n* Various fixes and enhancements to the radius and rp-pppoe plugins\r\n  have been added.\r\n\r\n* There is a new winbind plugin, from Andrew Bartlet of the Samba\r\n  team, which provides the ability to authenticate the peer against an\r\n  NT domain controller using MS-CHAP or MS-CHAPV2.\r\n\r\n* There is a new pppoatm plugin, by various authors, sent in by David\r\n  Woodhouse.\r\n\r\n* The multilink code has been substantially reworked.  The first pppd\r\n  for a bundle still controls the ppp interface, but it doesn't exit\r\n  until all the links in the bundle have terminated.  If the first\r\n  pppd is signalled to exit, it signals all the other pppds\r\n  controlling links in the bundle.\r\n\r\n* The TDB code has been updated to the latest version.  This should\r\n  eliminate the problem that some people have seen where the database\r\n  file (/var/run/pppd.tdb) keeps on growing.  Unfortunately, however,\r\n  the new code uses an incompatible database format.  For this reason,\r\n  pppd now uses /var/run/pppd2.tdb as the database filename.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was new in ppp-2.4.2.\r\n**************************\r\n\r\n* The CHAP code has been rewritten.  Pppd now has support for MS-CHAP\r\n  V1 and V2 authentication, both as server and client.  The new CHAP\r\n  code is cleaner than the old code and avoids some copyright problems\r\n  that existed in the old code.\r\n\r\n* MPPE (Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption) support has been added,\r\n  although the current implementation shouldn't be considered\r\n  completely secure.  (There is no assurance that the current code\r\n  won't ever transmit an unencrypted packet.)\r\n\r\n* James Carlson's implementation of the Extensible Authentication\r\n  Protocol (EAP) has been added.\r\n\r\n* Support for the Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) has been added.\r\n\r\n* Some new plug-ins have been included:\r\n  - A plug-in for kernel-mode PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet)\r\n  - A plug-in for supplying the PAP password over a pipe from another\r\n    process\r\n  - A plug-in for authenticating using a Radius server.\r\n\r\n* Updates and bug-fixes for the Solaris port.\r\n\r\n* The CBCP (Call Back Control Protocol) code has been updated.  There\r\n  are new options `remotenumber' and `allow-number'.\r\n\r\n* Extra hooks for plugins to use have been added.\r\n\r\n* There is now a `maxoctets' option, which causes pppd to terminate\r\n  the link once the number of bytes passed on the link exceeds a given\r\n  value.\r\n\r\n* There are now options to control whether pppd can use the IPCP\r\n  IP-Address and IP-Addresses options: `ipcp-no-address' and\r\n  `ipcp-no-addresses'.\r\n\r\n* Fixed several bugs, including potential buffer overflows in chat.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was new in ppp-2.4.1.\r\n**************************\r\n\r\n* Pppd can now print out the set of options that are in effect.  The\r\n  new `dump' option causes pppd to print out the option values after\r\n  option parsing is complete.  The `dryrun' option causes pppd to\r\n  print the options and then exit.\r\n\r\n* The option parsing code has been fixed so that options in the\r\n  per-tty options file are parsed correctly, and don't override values\r\n  from the command line in most cases.\r\n\r\n* The plugin option now looks in /usr/lib/pppd/<pppd-version> (for\r\n  example, /usr/lib/pppd/2.4.1b1) for shared objects for plugins if\r\n  there is no slash in the plugin name.\r\n\r\n* When loading a plugin, pppd will now check the version of pppd for\r\n  which the plugin was compiled, and refuse to load it if it is\r\n  different to pppd's version string.  To enable this, the plugin\r\n  source needs to #include \"pppd.h\" and have a line saying:\r\n\tchar pppd_version[] = VERSION;\r\n\r\n* There is a bug in zlib, discovered by James Carlson, which can cause\r\n  kernel memory corruption if Deflate is used with the lowest setting,\r\n  8.  As a workaround pppd will now insist on using at least 9.\r\n\r\n* Pppd should compile on Solaris and SunOS again.\r\n\r\n* Pppd should now set the MTU correctly on demand-dialled interfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was new in ppp-2.4.0.\r\n**************************\r\n\r\n* Multilink: this package now allows you to combine multiple serial\r\n  links into one logical link or `bundle', for increased bandwidth and\r\n  reduced latency.  This is currently only supported under the\r\n  2.4.x and later Linux kernels.\r\n\r\n* All the pppd processes running on a system now write information\r\n  into a common database.  I used the `tdb' code from samba for this.\r\n\r\n* New hooks have been added.\r\n\r\nFor a list of the changes made during the 2.3 series releases of this\r\npackage, see the Changes-2.3 file.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompression methods.\r\n********************\r\n\r\nThis package supports two packet compression methods: Deflate and\r\nBSD-Compress.  Other compression methods which are in common use\r\ninclude Predictor, LZS, and MPPC.  These methods are not supported for\r\ntwo reasons - they are patent-encumbered, and they cause some packets\r\nto expand slightly, which pppd doesn't currently allow for.\r\nBSD-Compress and Deflate (which uses the same algorithm as gzip) don't\r\never expand packets.\r\n\r\n\r\nContacts.\r\n*********\r\n\r\nThe comp.protocols.ppp newsgroup is a useful place to get help if you\r\nhave trouble getting your ppp connections to work.  Please do not send\r\nme questions of the form \"please help me get connected to my ISP\" -\r\nI'm sorry, but I simply do not have the time to answer all the\r\nquestions like this that I get.\r\n\r\nIf you find bugs in this package, please report them to the maintainer\r\nfor the port for the operating system you are using:\r\n\r\nLinux\t\t\tPaul Mackerras <paulus@samba.org>\r\nSolaris\t\t\tJames Carlson <carlson@workingcode.com>\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyrights:\r\n***********\r\n\r\nAll of the code can be freely used and redistributed.
